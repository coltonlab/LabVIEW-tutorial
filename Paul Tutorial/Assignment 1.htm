<p align="center"><u><b><font size="5">Programming Assignment 1: Unit Converter</font></b></u></p>
<hr>
<p align="left"><b>Problem:</b></p>
<p align="left">You need to create a unit converter program capable of 
converting miles to kilometers, feet to meters, and inches to centimeters.&nbsp; 
The conversion factors are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">1mi = 1.609344km<br>
1ft = 0.3048m<br>
1in = 2.54cm</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b>Requirements:</b></p>

<p align="left">To simplify this assignment (we wouldn't want the first one to 
be too difficult!), you are allowed the following on&nbsp; your front panel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">1. 3 numerical inputs<br>
2. 3 numerical outputs<br>
3. 3 boolean buttons labeled &quot;convert&quot;<br>
4. 1 stop button</p>

<p align="left">NOTE: It is advised to use labels for most if not all objects 
placed on the front panel.&nbsp; Not only do you want to create a working 
program, but you want to create an interface that is easy for anyone to use and 
understand. </p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left">In order to establish a real-time interface in which you can 
repeatedly make conversions of all three types, you are recommended to utilize a 
while loop and event structures.&nbsp; This means that when your program is run, 
the following must be true:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left">1. It continues running until a stop button is pressed.<br>
2. The conversions occur immediately when their corresponding boolean buttons are 
pressed.<br>
3. It can perform repeated conversions of all types.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><b><a href="Assignment%201%20Solution.htm">Sample Solution</a></b></p>

<p align="left">NOTE: Since there are so many ways in which a unit converter 
could be created, the sample solution is far from the best solution.&nbsp; 
Though easy to use, this particular interface can seem bulky and slow.&nbsp; 
Even when you have a working program that fits all requirements, you are 
encouraged to try and improve upon it.&nbsp; For example, a much better program 
would utilize 1 numerical input, 1 numerical output, and boolean controls to 
select which conversion to perform.&nbsp; So, as you learn more about LabView 
and become more familiarized with it, revisit your program to see if you can 
improve it even more.</p>
